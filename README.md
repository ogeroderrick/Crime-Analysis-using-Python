    # Project Title
    Crime Analysis Using Python 

    ## Overview

    This project demonstrates data visualization and analysis using Matplotlib, Folium, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, and HTML.
    It explores various data visualization techniques and analysis using different Python libraries. It involves using Matplotlib for creating customizable and interactive plots, Folium for geospatial data visualization, and Seaborn for statistical data visualization. The project's main platform is Jupyter Notebook, which facilitates code execution and explanation through markdown cells. Additionally, the project is exported to HTML to showcase the visualizations and findings interactively.

    ## Features

    - Utilizes Matplotlib to generate insightful and customizable charts and plots.
    - Leverages Folium for geospatial data visualization, enabling interactive maps with markers, clusters, and heat maps.
    - Employs Seaborn to create elegant and informative statistical visualizations.
    - Demonstrates data analysis and storytelling using Jupyter Notebook's interactive and markdown-based environment.
    - Exports the project to HTML for sharing interactive visualizations with stakeholders.

    ## Installation

    1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

    2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib folium seaborn jupyter nbconvert
    ```

    3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project:

    ```
    jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb
    ```

    ## Usage

    1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`your_notebook.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    2. Execute the cells to visualize the data and see the insights generated by the different libraries.
    3. Customize the code and plots to apply the visualizations to your datasets.
    4. Export the notebook to HTML to share the interactive visualizations with others:

    ```
    jupyter nbconvert --to html your_notebook.ipynb
    ```
